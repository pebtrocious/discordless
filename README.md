# Simple static website for discordless.com
Feel free to open PR's and help "developing" it by adding more altyernatives and fixing wrong information

## localhost
```
npm i
```
```
npm run dev
```

## IMPORTANT
Yes this website was 100% vibecoded (if you didn't realize already by the design), because I wanted to host it ASAP and I think it's enough as it is since I share it on X and don't aim for it to be seen from search engines like Google, but if someone wants to change that, feel free to make PR with changes!
